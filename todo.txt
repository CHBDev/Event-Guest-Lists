//TODO
1. Readd csv import to list tab
2. add notes system - with a "do this suggested action button option"
3. add info section for selected tabs (maybe this is in the tab title again I don't know)
4. add modding a tab via its edit command
4. add modding a tab contents via another tab
5. create generic "new system"

maybe in view tab the rows of the table all have options to update other view
but in edit mode they only have option to update the tab itself?

//TEST
